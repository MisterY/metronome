# Alen's Metronome

Even though there are some nice metronomes out there, I was not completely happy with any of them. Each one was missing some small detail.

This is my version of metronome. Implemented in JavaScript, it can be practically run anywhere. I've implemented it with React in order to lear a bit more about it, as well.

Goals:

- Run anywhere (browser, app), easy to start
- Wide tempo range
- Tempo names
- Mechanical click sound, multiple options available
- Precision
- Practical operation (keyboard, mouse)
- Modern look

## Deployment
